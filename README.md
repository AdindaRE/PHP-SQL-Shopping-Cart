# shoppingcart
In this demo I've created a shopping cart system with PHP and MySQL. 
The shopping cart system will allow visitors to browse for products, add to cart products, and place orders, the orders are stored in a session. 

The images are not my own and solely used for the purpose of demostrating PHP and MySQL skills.
